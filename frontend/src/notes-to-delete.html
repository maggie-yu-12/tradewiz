Individual.js TODO

Create header element. Since it's on both pages consider inheritance? but if we're lazy just copy paste
- div for header
- div for logo
- div for search engine

Do we want to lock it at the top?

Maggie's AlphaVantage API Key: KZQ08TK5X6QQQDOB

- Assume individual page has a const "stockAbbreviation" which is what is input in the search engine
- Retrieve company information from AlphaVantage accordingly
