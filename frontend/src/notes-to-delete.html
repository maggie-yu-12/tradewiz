Individual.js TODO

Create header element. Since it's on both pages consider inheritance? but if we're lazy just copy paste
- div for header
- div for logo
- div for search engine

Do we want to lock it at the top?

- Assume individual page has a const "stockAbbreviation" which is what is input in the search engine
- Retrieve company information from AlphaVantage accordingly

PROGRESS
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
commit 06e4a7bdc8da77d8070ba0903dbe5fd24145d474 retrieve company data from search engine
Date: Wed Jan 11 22:17:45 2023 -0800

- added cors 2.8.5 as a package
- If you search a stock correctly from Home.jsx such as MSFT, the company info will pop up.
- TODO: add the company abbreviation to pathname. Currently only /stockname but would ideally want it to be
/stockdata/{name}
- TODO: Doesn't work when you try to search from the search bar on /stockname. Thus need to change the path
